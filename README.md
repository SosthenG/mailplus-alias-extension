# MailPlus Alias Extension

:warning: This project is still in development. I built it for my own needs, so it might not suit yours.
However, feel free to open an issue or contribute if you find a bug or want to improve this extension.

## Features

This extension allows you to create email aliases for your Synology MailPlus account directly from your browser. Idea is the same as [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/) but with your own server, own domain and with no limitation because you can create as much alias as you want for your MailPlus account.

## Target

This extension can only be used by people using [Synology MailPlus Server](https://www.synology.com/fr-fr/dsm/feature/mailplus).
Please also note that your DSM account need to have the "MailPlus Server" permission. This will not work with the "MailPlus" permission as alias creation is made on the server side.

:warning: Accounts with this permission will have access to the entire configuration of your email server, so it should only be given to the server administrator.

This extension has only been tested with Firefox 91.0.2 yet, so it might not work with others versions and probably will not with other browser. Support to more browsers might be added later.
